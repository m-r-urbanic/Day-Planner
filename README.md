# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
A color coded schedule for your work day

# Description
This is a color coded schedule that allows you to take notes and save them for each specific time. The colors change based on if the time has passed or not

# Installation

This project can be downloaded (as a whole) and ran in Visual Studio Code with no additional modifications.

# Usage

Grey boxes mean the hour has already passed, red means that is the current hour, green means that is a future hour. Type into any of the text boxes and click the save button next to it. That will save the text (for that box only) in the local storage
